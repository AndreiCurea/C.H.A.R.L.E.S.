Combustion Hazzard Autonomous Robot for Localization and Environmental Scanning

A hobby project of mine that involves building up an exploration robot from scratch, using different types of technologies. The purpose of this project is to monitor VOCs and other harmful gases in office/industrial buildings, while also creating a map of the surroundings to plot the acquired data on it.

I desired it to have LiDAR, ROS implementation, main computer board and high modularity when it comes to the electrical/mechanical parts.

It has custom PCBs, custom 3D parts, and code for the microcontrollers and the main computer.

Currently, the project only works remote controlled, as I've yet to develop the automation part of the code.
